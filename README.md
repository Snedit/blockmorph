## Problem Statement

Transitioning from Web2 to Web3 is complex and challenging, especially for existing applications lacking blockchain infrastructure. There is a need for a simplified integration process to enable broader adoption of blockchain technologies.

## Solution

BlockMorph offers a suite of tools and APIs to streamline the adoption of Web3 technologies, focusing on:
- **Ease of Use:** Intuitive APIs for developers.
- **Scalability:** Optimized for high transaction volumes using Polygon and Avalanche.
- **Security:** Enhanced security features using blockchain's decentralized nature.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, MUI
- **Backend:** Node.js, Python
- **Blockchain:** Solidity, Brownie (Polygon, Avalanche)
- **Database:** Lighthouse
- **Tools:** Core wallet, Web3.js

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14+)
- Git
- Core wallet

### Installation

1. **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Snedit/blockmorph
    cd blockmorph
    ```
